# Breast_Cancer_Classification
A simple machine learning model to classify whether the Breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this, Random Forest Algorithm has been used. Label Encoding has also been used to preprocess the dataset.

## Analysing the Dataset

Here, we can see that the dataset contains  569 rows and 33 columns.

Here, ‘Diagnosis’ is the column which we are going to predict and hence it is the dependent variable , which says if the cancer is M = malignant or B = benign. 

## Data Preprocessing
We need to encode the data into 0's and 1's, where 1 means M (malignant) and 0 means B(benign). It is done using LabelEncoder.
